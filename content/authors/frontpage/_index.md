I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [Vancouver School of Economics](https://economics.ubc.ca/) and the [Center for Innovative Data in Economic Research](https://economics.ubc.ca/cider/research-activity/) at the University of British Columbia, and a member of the [Data Science](https://datascience.quantecon.org) team at [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org).

My research is focused on understanding economic behavior in dynamic social and economic networks. I develop tools to identify the driving forces behind the evolution of social interaction, and apply them to real data to study the subsequent impact of endogenous social structure on economic processes — market transactions, learning, opinion exchange, trading in influence, and collective action — that are set in these complex environments.
