- ECO4400 Games and Decisions
    - This advanced elective course provides an introduction to the applied theoretical modeling of games and decision making, designed to be both practical for and accessible to students from a wide range of backgrounds. The course focuses on problems arising in business and economic environments, such as in public economics and industrial organization, with the primary goal of promoting critical and strategic thinking in both professional settings and everyday life.

        - Selected student comments:
            - I appreciate that Philip takes a learning forward approach to instructing this class, he is transparent about being 'an easy grader' and it is obvious that he is more focused on learning than he is on his students getting grades. I think this is conducive to a healthy learning environment, at least for me personally. I think I have learned more in this class than 90% of my other economics courses. The assignments are directly correlated with what we learned in class and they are short and to the point. There is no busy work asked of us which allows me to put in ample time into actual important studying/learning with the materials given. He always gives great detailed feedback and follow through points. I also enjoy MobLab.
            - Dr. Solimine was very helpful in teaching us this course, and always offered additional help if we got lost on a problem. I really enjoyed having him as a professor.
            - I really liked how you provided detailed feedback on the exams and problem sets. It really helped me understand and learn from my mistakes.
            - Going to office hours was very helpful, where you gave full in depth explanations of the homework and exams each time for my understanding. The Mob Lab was fun to do because of the practical application of the material we learned was being put to use. I do not like senseless learning... ...with this class each week we learned then you would provide examples, sometimes in games relevance or real life economics issues where game theory could be implemented. With that in mind I thought it helped me be engaged a bit more.

            - His effort and time put in outside class is outstanding. Genuinely cares about his students. One of the best teachers I've had at fsu. 
            - I really appreciated the decision to have video lectures on MTuF and face-to-face lectures (or screen-to-screen I guess) lectures on WTh. This allowed for students to learn on their own in the beginning of the week and have ample time to ask a question during class before a quiz or assignment is due.
            - I liked his zoom lectures every Wednesday and Thursday. They helped a lot with the pre recorded lectures he gave. He would take the time to help all of us out which I like. 
            - He helps in office hours very well and tries to make sure everyone understands what is going on even though its a tough class. 
            - ...he mixed the work load but also giving us time to take in the information without us just doing it to do it. I know for a fact I will be using game theory everyday of my life. 


- ECO2023 Principles of Microeconomics
    - This introductory course covered basic topics in microeconomics, from supply and demand to market structure, capital markets, and financial economics. The primary goal of this course is to provide students with the insight to recognize economic problems and the tools to analyze them. Being filled (almost) entirely with incoming business-school freshmen, the course was designed to promote critical thinking and to encourage values which are important to academic achievement at the collegiate level.

        - Selected student comments:
            - Philip was a very good teacher. He showed passion in the subject matter, teaches in a dynamic way, has good intentions for his students, etc. As a junior, I have not found many professors like this and I don't think I am the only one who feels this way. 
            - I enjoyed having Phil as a teacher. He knows a lot about economics, math, and science. FSU is lucky to have him! 
            - Always was clear in explaining everything. If somebody would not understand he would demonstrate what it looked like on a graph to provide a clearer understanding.
            - I greatly appreciated that Philip Solimine was very understanding and thoughtful. He highly encouraged meeting with him during his office hours to help with materials that we might not understand and he would also backtrack and explain further certain parts of the lessons that he just thought might have been difficult or that we did not seem to grasp well. He cared very much that his students were learning and understanding
