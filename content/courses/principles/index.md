  <b>Course description:</b>
  This introductory course covered basic topics in microeconomics, from supply and demand to market structure, capital markets, and financial economics. The primary goal of this course is to provide students with the insight to recognize economic problems and the tools to analyze them. Being filled (almost) entirely with incoming business-school freshmen, the course was designed to promote critical thinking and to encourage values that are important to academic achievement at the collegiate level. <br/><br/>

        <li>Philip was a very good teacher. He showed passion in the subject matter, teaches in a dynamic way, has good intentions for his students, etc. As a junior, I have not found many professors like this and I don't think I am the only one who feels this way.</li>
        <li>I enjoyed having Phil as a teacher. He knows a lot about economics, math, and science. FSU is lucky to have him!</li>
        <li>Always was clear in explaining everything. If somebody would not understand he would demonstrate what it looked like on a graph to provide a clearer understanding.</li>
        <li>I greatly appreciated that Philip Solimine was very understanding and thoughtful. He highly encouraged meeting with him during his office hours to help with materials that we might not understand and he would also backtrack and explain further certain parts of the lessons that he just thought might have been difficult or that we did not seem to grasp well. He cared very much that his students were learning and understanding.</li>
