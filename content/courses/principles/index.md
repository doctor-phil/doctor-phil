  <b>Course description:</b>
  This advanced elective course provides an introduction to the applied theoretical modeling of games and decision making, designed to be both practical for and accessible to students from a wide range of backgrounds. The course focuses on problems arising in business and economic environments, such as in public economics and industrial organization, with the primary goal of promoting critical and strategic thinking in both professional settings and everyday life.<br/><br/>

        <li>Philip was a very good teacher. He showed passion in the subject matter, teaches in a dynamic way, has good intentions for his students, etc. As a junior, I have not found many professors like this and I don't think I am the only one who feels this way.</li>
        <li>I enjoyed having Phil as a teacher. He knows a lot about economics, math, and science. FSU is lucky to have him!</li>
        <li>Always was clear in explaining everything. If somebody would not understand he would demonstrate what it looked like on a graph to provide a clearer understanding.</li>
        <li>I greatly appreciated that Philip Solimine was very understanding and thoughtful. He highly encouraged meeting with him during his office hours to help with materials that we might not understand and he would also backtrack and explain further certain parts of the lessons that he just thought might have been difficult or that we did not seem to grasp well. He cared very much that his students were learning and understanding.</li>

**Abstract:** We study the optimal control of the mean and variance of the network state vector. We develop an algorithm that uses projected gradient descent to optimize the control input placement, subject to constraints on the state that must be achieved at a given time threshold; seeking an input placement that moves the moment at minimum cost. First, we solve the state-selection problem for a number of variants of the first and second moment, and find solutions related to the eigenvalues of the systems' Gramian matrices. We then nest this state selection into projected gradient descent to design an optimal input augmentation.
