  <b>Course description:</b>
  This course presents an introduction to data science, economics, programming, and how they can be used to understand the world around us. We focus on learning practical programming skills for the workplace and future studies in economics and finance, envisioned as a complement to econometrics. Unlike other courses in computer science, data science, or statistics, the emphasis of this course includes both the programming and the statistics necessary to analyze data and subsequently interpret results through the lens of economics. <br/><br/>

        <li>This course covers a ton of advanced topics without any prereqs, which is a great idea. It exposes students to subjects with really interesting applications (my favorite was the graph/network content) that they wouldn't otherwise see until the end of their degree, if ever.</li>

        <li>Dr. Phil is a great instructor always go through everything in detail. The assigned homework was manageable and relevant to class material. TA Josh is also very helpful, he explained all the problems I had clearly during his office hour. Thank you both!</li>
